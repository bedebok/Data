#+TITLE: Cataloguing manuscripts in Org-Mode

The following guidelines are intended as an aide to cataloguing the manuscript corpus using Org-Mode for easy conversion to XML.

* Title and Header
The file opens with a title following Org-Mode's ~#+TITLE:~ macro. This is displayed at the top of the Org file when visualized in GitHub and is otherwise not converted to XML. Thus any descriptive title can be applied. Best practice is to begin with the shelfmark followed by an optional short descriptor.

#+BEGIN_src org 
#+TITLE: AM 70 8vo. Cantus Sororum
#+END_src

These will be converted into the header in XML.

Following the title, a short description of one to two sentences is given in prose introducing the manuscript. This will eventually be converted to XML and should therefore follow the best practice for [[#Prose][prose]]. It must all be on a single line (no hard returns).

#+BEGIN_src org
A copy of [[BIRGITTA][St. Bridget]] of Sweden's /Cantus Sororum/ in Low German. Contains many added prayers and marginal notes in both Danish and Low German.
#+END_src

This converts to an element ~<head>~ with the proper XML tags for names and other elements.

#+BEGIN_src xml
<head>
A copy of <name key="BIRGITTA"> St. Bridget</name> of Sweden's <title>Cantus Sororum</title> in Low German. Contains many added prayers and marginal notes in both Danish and Low German.
</head>
#+END_src

Following this short description, a link to an internal image is added on a new line. These images are in the folder imgs/mss, two folders up the directory from the local Org file for the manuscript description.

#+BEGIN_src org
[[../../imgs/mss/AM08-0070.jpg]]
#+END_src

Once saved in Org mode, this header provides a brief overview within GitHub for the manuscript.

* PhysDesc
A top-level header ~* PhysDesc~ encloses the physical description of the manuscript and contains two subheaders: ~** Binding~ and ~** Quire Structure~.

The table at the top level PhysDesc contains the following rows:

- SUPPORT :: specify ~pap~ (paper), ~perg~ (parchment) or ~mixed~ (both paper and parchment)
- NUMBER :: number of leaves following the formula ~i + 100 + i~ using small roman numerals to indicate flyleaves
- SIZE :: leaf size following the formula ~180 125~ indicating height and width in millimeters
- WRITING AREA :: following the same formula as leaf size to indicate the height and width of the writing area in millimeters
- COLUMNS :: number of columns; if mixed, write e.g. ~1 2~ (one or two columns)
- LINES :: number of lines per page. If a range, write e.g. ~25 30~ for the lower and upper number.
- FOLIATION :: indicate whether the manuscript is foliated (f) or paginated (p) followed by the number, e.g. ~f 1-100~ for "foliated 1-100".

An example is given below:

|--------------+---------|
| SUPPORT      | perg    |
| NUMBER       | 208     |
| SIZE         | 178 125 |
| WRITING AREA | 125 85  |
| COLUMNS      | 1       |
| LINES        | 25      |
| FOLIATION    | f 1-208 |
|--------------+---------|

This gets converted to XML as follows:

#+BEGIN_src xml
<supportDesc material="perg">
<support>parchment</support>
<extent>208.<dimensions>
<height>178</height>
<width>125</width>
</dimensions></extent>
...
#+END_src

#+TODO: Code for writing area, columns etc

** Binding
A description of the binding is given as a table with an optional prose paragraph afterwards, which will be encoded in a ~<note>~ tag.

* History

* Contents
The following items are available in the table:

- Loc :: locus
- Type :: text type
- Level :: item level
- Text :: Name of text
- Key :: Text key
- Rub/Inc/Exp :: Rubric, incipit, explicit
- Lang :: language(s)
- Status :: status
- Author :: author

* General best practice
** Prose
